	   <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm. It measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. In other words, it helps us understand how the algorithm's performance scales with the input data. An efficient algorithm has a lower time complexity, which means it can handle larger inputs without significantly increasing execution time.</p>

    <p><b>Space complexity</b>, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory or space an algorithm needs to complete its task. It is often denoted using the notation O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. Space complexity is crucial in optimizing algorithms, especially in situations with limited memory resources. Minimizing space complexity can lead to more efficient and scalable solutions.</p>
